# Abstract

Background

When people with Parkinson’s disease (PD) can no longer look after themselves, they may move to a nursing home (institution). Institutionalisation has major social and financial implications. Being able to predict future risk of institutionalisation would improve patient counselling and healthcare planning. We developed and validated a prognostic model to predict institutionalisation risk in PD patients. 

Methods

We analysed 4 prospective PD incidence cohorts from the UK (CamPalGN, PICNICS, PINE) and Sweden (NYPUM) using a one-stage individual-participant-data meta-analysis. A Royston-Parmar survival model was developed to predict 10-year institutionalisation risk, adjusting for age, sex, motor impairment, disease stage, and cognitive function. Internal-external cross-validation (IECV) was used to assess performance. Discrimination was assessed using Harrell’s Concordance (C). Calibration was assessed using O/E, calibration slope and flexible calibration plots. The latter was achieved by fitting a second Royston-Parmar model to the external dataset using the complementary log-log transform of the predicted risks as the sole predictor. We plotted the ‘predicted-observed’ risk from this second model against the predicted risk from the original model. 

Results

Among 723 PD patients, 215 were institutionalised within 10 years. From IECV the model had good discrimination performance across all 4 datasets (C-statistic range: 0.71-0.90). However, the range of calibration slopes showed evidence of both under and over prediction across studies (0.84-1.29). Calibration plots were good in PICNICS and PINE, but the model overpredicted in CamPalGN and underpredicted in NYPUM. Therefore, the model had to be recalibrated for the CamPAIGN and NYPUM datasets

Conclusion

The prognostic model showed good discrimination performance. However, calibration varied between studies. It is important to consider heterogeneity between populations when using these models and we recommend further validation (and recalibration where necessary) before use in settings which are dissimilar to the cohorts in which they were developed.
